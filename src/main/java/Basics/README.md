# README

The Main class is the entry point to this program. It contains three static methods, `pluralize`, `flipNHeads`, and `clock`. They perform the following functionality:

## `pluralize`

Takes a `String` and an `int` as inputs and returns a formatted `String` based on the value of the number.

## `flipNHeads`

Takes an `int` that reflects a desired number of consecutive coin flips showing heads. When this value is met, the function terminates and outputs the number of iterations it required to meet this mark.

## `clock`

This uses the `java.time` namespace to show a clock in the terminal. The clock displays a new value every second.
